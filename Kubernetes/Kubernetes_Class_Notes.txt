	Kubernetes :::
	
		It is a open-source container orchestration tool. to manage and deploy the containerized workload.		
		Micro-service based application Architecture.		
		This can be compared to Docker-Swarm.
		
		Kubernetes was owned by google.
		
		
	-	Kubernetes Architecture
	-	Kubernetes Installation & Configuration
	-	Kubernetes Master - Workernodes
	-	Working with Kubernetes	
			Pods
			Deployment controllers
			Namespaces
			Volumes 
			Kubernetes Services
			
			
	-	Kubernetes Architecture ::::
	
		Master 		==>
			Cluster
				Workernode1
				Workernode2
				Workernode3
		
		Cluster ::: --> It is a collection of Workernodes
		
		Kubernetes :
			Self-Managed (Open Source)
			Managed Service from service provider
				Eg.:
					AWS --> EKS
					AZ  --> AKS
					GCP --> GKS
	
	
	Core Kubernetes Architecture
	
	Master
		APIServer
		Scheduler
		ETCD 
		Controller Manager
	Workernodes
		kube-proxy
		CRI - Docker 
		Kubelet
		
	POD :: 	It is an atomic unit of schedule.
			It runs the container
			Collection controller components.

	Installation of Open-Source Kubernetes along with its cluser.
	Pods  &  Deployment controller
	
	
****************
*5th June. 2023*
****************

		
	Installation of Open-Source Kubernetes::
	
		Kubernetes-Master				VM 
			Kubernetes-Workernode1		VM
			Kubernetes-Workernode2		VM
			Kubernetes-Workernode3		VM 
			
	
	
	Installation & Configuration ::
		kubeadm 	==>	
		minikube 	==> light weight K8s
		
	Managed Services :::
	
		AWS --> EKS 
		Az	--> AKS 
		GCP --> GKS 
		
	
	Instal Kubernetes using Kubeadm :::
	
		Kubernetes-Master				VM 			==> to create pods, schedule.
			Kubernetes-Workernode1		VM				
			Kubernetes-Workernode2		VM
			Kubernetes-Workernode3		VM 	
	
	
	Hardware requirements :::
		2 CPU or More
		3 GB RAM or more
		Enable full connectivity across the cluster the master nodes 
		Disable Selinux 
		swap off
	
	
	
	Kubernetes Concepts :::
	
		Kubectl 
		
		Pod 
		Deployment Controller 
		Services 
	
	
	Namespace ==> is a logical pratitioning of the cluster.
	
	
	
	
	Pod (containers)
	
			3-tier archi . user_registration_Module :
			
			
			front-End 				container/pod1	
			Application 			pod2		---> failed ???
			Dbase - backend.		pod3
	
	Service ::::
			ClusterIP -- Default service
			NodePort 	-- used to expose the pod to internet.
			LoadBalancer -- LoadBalancing 
	
	
	
	host port :::
	
		port mapping / binding 
		
			-p 8086:80
			
			
			Node Port :::
			
			
		master ::
			workernode1,2,3,4,................,50
			
				workernode5 ==> port 8086
				
				I need a port to expose my web application. and that port should handled at cluster level NOT at a specific HOST Level.
			
		NodePort ---> 30000 range of port.
